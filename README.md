# KKBoxProject
For MS&amp;E 226: Fundamentals of Data Science

## Problem Overview
It is important for subscription-based music services like KKBox to have an accurate prediction of its users' streaming hours. Daily usage is directly related to the amount the company pays its artists. It is also important for KKBox to know whether a user will churn after his/her subscription expires. In fact, churn rate is a crucial metric in measuring the company's health as it costs more to acquire new users than to keep existing ones.

The objective of this project is to predict daily streaming time and churn rate of KKBox users in addition to determining what characteristics churning users tend to have.

## Data Source
The dataset for this daily usage and user churn prediction project is from Kaggle:

## Modeling
I used R to test various models, including OLS, OLS with regularization, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.

## Findings
Best models, inference, and statistical results (multiple hypothesis testing,false positives, post-selection inference) of the models are discussed in the report.
